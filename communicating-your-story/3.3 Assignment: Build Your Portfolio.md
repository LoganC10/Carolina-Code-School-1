Build a portfolio using best practices for displaying a set of projects, contact information, and a personal bio.

Build a portfolio that showcases the following:

* 3-4 Projects
* Easily-accessible contact information
* Easily-accessible job search collateral (Github, LinkedIn, and résumé)
* Short bio

We will review your portfolios in small groups. These small groups could include campus staff, alumni, recruiters, or advisory board members.
