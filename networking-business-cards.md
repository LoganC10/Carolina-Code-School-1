# BUSINESS CARDS: THE LOW DOWN

As we’re nearing demo day and the job hunt, some of you may be thinking of ways to jump on the networking gravy train early. Business cards are a great way to do so. If you’re having a great conversation at Demo Day, a meet up or coffee shop, you can make sure to leave a token to remember (and hopefully contact) you by. Business cards are in no way a mandatory, but if you’re interested they’re a great asset to add to your job hunting toolkit!

## HERE ARE A FEW POINTERS TO KEEP IN MIND

* In addition to the regular info that goes on a business card, make sure to add your personal portfolio site (more to come on that) or your github url
* You want this to be the one stop shop for someone to see all the information they may need about your dope development skills ;)
* Give yourself a title! If you are a full-stack dev with some serious design chops, maybe write "full stack development and design”. "full stack junior developer" and "junior web developer" are also fine.
* Don’t be afraid of the word “Junior”. It's not at all mandatory or even necessary, but we want you to be confident and honest about your skill set.
* Show some personality! Don’t be afraid to be creative with your cards, but remember that you want people to remember you for the right reasons! Be professional but fun!
* If you're hoping to have business cards on Demo Day, make sure to check out the processing and shipping details of the site you're using. Give yourself plenty to time!
