Using the skills you gained from the <a href="./2.0 Lesson: Decoding Job Listings.md" target="_blank">Decoding Job Listings</a> lesson, use 5 job postings that you've applied to and write a brief summary for each one containing the following:

1. What does the company do? build?
2. What is the job posting looking for?
3. What tech skills are needed?

These summaries should be added to your Trello cards for each of the job postings.
