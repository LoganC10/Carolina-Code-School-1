## Trello and Career Services Tracking

We will use Trello to track job applications, interviews, and freelance projects. If you already have a personal account tied to the email we have on file, you will receive an email notifying you that you've been added to a private board; otherwise. If you do not have an account, you will receive an e-mail to create an account and sign up for a private project board.

### How we will do it

Once you open your board, there are six columns of categories: Need to Apply; Prepping Application; Applied, Pending Decision; Received Response; Freelance Projects; and Application Resources

#### Need to Apply 

Add a new card for each job you're planning to apply for. Each card title should include the company name and job title. Each card description should include all job posting details (link to job posting, contact information, relevant e-mails and phone numbers, etc.)

#### Prepping Application

These are applications you're currently working on, e.g applications you would like feedback on before submitting.

If you want feedback, please leave a note for the Ops team to review your application.

#### Applied, Pending Decision

These are jobs you've applied for, and you're waiting to hear back. The Ops team will review this board regularly when you're in full application mode, and we will submit recommendations on your behalf.

#### Received Response

These are applications you've received a response to. Please include the response you received as a comment on that application's card, so that the Ops team may help you assess next steps or help you improve future applications.

#### Freelance Projects

This is where you'll add cards for any freelance projects you're working on, so we may communicate if you need any guidance.

#### Application Resources

Each graduate enrolled in Career Support is required to create a portfolio, resume, and cover letter. You will add these resources here in order to receive feedback from the Ops team.

*Make sure as you create cards, that each job listing or resource has its own card. That way, you can move each card to the appropriate stage of progress.*

### Instructions

1. Click "+Add another Card" and create the card title. Remember, each title is comprised of the company name and job title you're applying for.
2. Once you've created the card title, click "Add Card". This will save the card with the name you created.
3. Next, click the card title and add any necessary content. This may include a description, comments and/or attachments.
4. Make sure you include the following in the card description:  
    * A link to the job posting
    * Contact information
    * Any relevant emails and phone numbers for the CTO, Head of Development team, etc.
    * No need to include your name in the Card headings because it's in YOUR board.
